# Starter
This is  repository for a starter API governance editor that uses the Monaco editor and Spectral rules to make for a standlone solution you can use to lint OpenAPI specifications using Spectral rulesets.

This is a build -- if you want the full solution you can grab [the base solution I have forked from the Italian Government](https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/starter). It is one of the slickest client-side approach to using Spectral rules and governance I have seen, and I recommend looking at the [API Starter Pack](https://github.com/teamdigitale/api-starter-kit) produced by the Italian government.
